# OPC-UA Exploitation Framework / by Claroty Team82

### TL;DR
Advanced OPC-UA framework for vulnerability research & exploitation. 

Using this framework, we've implemented many unique attacks against OPC-UA implementation - all of which we, or other researchers, responsibly disclosed. So far, using `OPC-UA Exploitation Framework` we found & disclosed ~50 CVEs.

### Background
In the past few years we ([Claroty Research - Team82](https://claroty.com/team82)) conducted an extensive analysis of the [OPC-UA](https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/) network protocol prevalent in operational technology (OT) networks worldwide. During that research, we found and privately disclosed critical vulnerabilities in OPC-UA implementations from a number of leading vendors that have built their respective products on top of the protocol stack. The affected vendors sell these products to companies operating in many industries within the ICS domain and so with each vulnerability found in a protocol-stack library there are many other pieces of software and applications that are becoming vulnerable.

With our `OPC-UA Exploitation Framework` we hope that both software companies and OPC-UA vendors could test their code-base and improve the security of their products. We also welcome other security researchers to use this framework and responsibly disclose vulns/bugs they find to the respective vendors.

We used this framework many times, including:
- [Pwn2Own ICS 2020](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/10/28/pwn2own-miami-bringing-ics-into-the-pwn2own-world)
- [Pwn2Own ICS 2022](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2021/10/22/our-ics-themed-pwn2own-contest-returns-to-miami-in-2022)
- [Pwn2Own ICS 2023](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/11/30/pwn2own-returns-to-miami-beach-for-2023)

As part of our research we also wrote a detailed series into OPC-UA - [OPC UA Deep Dive: A Complete Guide to the OPC UA Attack Surface](https://claroty.com/team82/research/opc-ua-deep-dive-a-complete-guide-to-the-opc-ua-attack-surface) and even released an [OPC-UA Network Fuzzer](https://claroty.com/team82/research/team82-releases-homegrown-opc-ua-network-fuzzer-based-on-boofuzz)

### What's supported?
We divided the framework to four categories: `attacks`, `corpus`, `sanity`, and `server`
- `Sanity`: sanity payloads such as reading nodes, getting specific NodeID information given a namespace and NodeID, etc.
- `Attacks`: unique OPC-UA specific attacks that can cause a denial of service, leak sensitive information, or even execute code remotely.
- `Corpus`: reproducing payloads from corpus. Useful for fuzzing iterations and reproducers.
- `Server`: Simple server implementation (currently one example with XSS payloads).

### Command Line
Basic Usage: `python main.py SERVER_TYPE IP_ADDR PORT ENDPOINT_ADDRESS FUNC_TYPE [DIR]`
Examples:
1. Sanity - `python main.py prosys 1.2.3.4 53530 /OPCUA/SimulationServer sanity`
2. Attack (DoS) - `python main.py prosys 1.2.3.4 53530 /OPCUA/SimulationServer thread_pool_wait_starvation`

### Corpus Attacks
We've implemented a couple of corpus usage attacks, mostly to reproduce bugs we found using fuzzers.
- `opcua_message_boofuzz_db` - can be used to shoot an entire boofuzz db at a target
- `opcua_message_file` - can be used to shoot an a single file or directory of files with OPC-UA payloads (OPC-UA content itself)

Take a look at the corpus we have collected - `input_corpus_minimized`. They are the result of many hours of fuzzing different targets via various methods and tools.

### Rogue Server Implementation (to attack clients)
Currently, the server is a stand-alone script which is built on top of Python OPC-UA ([asyncua](https://github.com/FreeOpcUa/opcua-asyncio)). The current example was used in some RCE client exploitation (for example see [here](https://security.inductiveautomation.com/?tcuUid=379811a7-c116-4855-b1ce-a2b2d828b5ef)).
